<h3>Our goal is to help people who are blind achieve a higher level of independence so they can function by themselves in society.</h3>

<h3>We are always in need of updated software for our computer lab.  The specialized programs that make the computer accessible to persons who are blind and visually impaired are very expensive but we must stay up-to-date to help our blind patrons use computers adequately to get along in todayâ€™s ever changing environment. The D.O.R. will sponsor a blind person to receive a copy of Jaws or Zoom Text, but these are installed on their home computers. We need these programs to be installed on our computers here at Blindness Support Services where much of the computer training takes place.</h3>
 
<h3>We would also like to have extra white canes for any blind people who come in to our establishment and have lost or broken their canes or so that if they need one for the first time we can give them one. These canes have special tips which periodically need replacing when they wear out. with use. We would like to have these on hand so that when a blind person coming in to our facility needs one of these canes as a replacement cane they can receive one. They certainly should not have to wait for one to come in the mail. Their mobility is dependent on having a white cane in good condition.</h3>
 
<h3>We are in need of a Braille embosser and Braille transcription software that will create braille from modern computers. We only have one embosser and it does not hook into most of our computers because it is too old. When transcribing Braille we have to use a very old computer system. At this time we do not have the resources to buy a new embosser. We can only do so much with the resources that we have. We are hoping that the Give Big Riverside program will help us better serve the blind community within Riverside.</h3>
